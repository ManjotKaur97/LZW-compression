# What is LZW Compression Algorithm
LZW algorithm is looseless compression technique used typically for compressing GIFs and PDFs.

# Why LZW Algorithm
There are two categories of compression techniques. 
1. Lossy - Here unnecessary and less important information is removed to reduce the size.
2. Lossless - Here duplicate data in graphic is removed.It reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy.

# LZW-compression Results achieved
Implementation of LZW algorithm in C++ for compression and decompression of text files.
Compression of file of 1MB to 700 kBs and decompress back to original files.
